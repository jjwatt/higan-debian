Description: Accurate Nintendo multi-system emulator
 higan is an emulator for Nintendos SNES, NES, Gameboy, Gameboy Color
 and Gameboy Advance. It was formerly called bsnes and the SNES
 emulation is especially complete and polished.
 .
 higan strives to provide the most faithful hardware emulation possible.
 It focuses on accuracy and clean code, rather than speed and special
 features. It is meant as a reference emulator to document how the underlying
 hardware works. As a result the minimum system requirements are high.
 .
 There are three profiles that govern the amount of accuracy and required
 system resources of the SNES emulation. Which profile to use can be set with:
 .
 # update-alternatives --config higan
