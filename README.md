higan-debian
============

The debian source package for higan, a multi-Nintendo system emulator, with branches for my patches.

Original code is in higan-094. I've added my new dsc along with debian unstable's dsc.
I should clean this up later so that ther is a clean debian branch along with a branch with my changes.
For now, you should be able to build this with debuild -us -uc and install it with debi.
